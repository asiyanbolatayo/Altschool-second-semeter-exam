            <h2>Project Pitch</h2>
            <p>
              "The Future of Cloud Engineering" explores how serverless architectures, AI/ML integration,
               and advanced automation are converging to create hyper-efficient, 
               self-healing, and infinitely scalable cloud environments. 
               My project demonstrates the foundational steps towards building these next-generation cloud platforms, 
               emphasizing security, cost-optimization, and developer experience from the ground up.
